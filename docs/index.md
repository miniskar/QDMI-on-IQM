# QDMI on IQM

**QDMI on IQM** is IQM's official, production-ready implementation of the
[Quantum Device Management Interface (QDMI)](https://github.com/Munich-Quantum-Software-Stack/qdmi).

By providing this officially supported implementation, IQM empowers HPC centers and middleware
developers to embed IQM processors via a stable, vendor-agnostic standard—no fragile, bespoke
adapter chains, just clean integration through a shared interface.

The library is written in C++20 and communicates with IQM hardware through the
[IQM Server API](https://resonance.iqm.tech/docs/api-reference), handling session control,
calibration queries, and job lifecycle management transparently.
Pre-compiled binaries for all major platforms are provided alongside a Python wrapper for
straightforward installation via `pip` or `uv`.

## API Reference

The generated API references cover both the C++ library and the Python package:
the [C++ API reference](capi/index) documents all public QDMI functions and types exposed by the
library, while the [Python API reference](api/iqm/qdmi/index) covers the `iqm-qdmi` package
including the Qiskit backend and its sampler and estimator primitives.
