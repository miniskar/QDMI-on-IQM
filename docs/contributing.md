## Guidelines

Please adhere to the following guidelines to help the project grow sustainably.

### Core Guidelines

- ["Commit early and push often"](https://www.worklytics.co/blog/commit-early-push-often).
- Write meaningful commit messages, preferably using [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev) for additional context.
- Focus on a single feature or bug at a time and only touch relevant files.
  Split multiple features into separate contributions.
- Add tests for new features to ensure they work as intended.
- Document new features.
  For user-facing changes, consider adding documentation updates to the relevant guides.
- Add tests for bug fixes to demonstrate the fix.
- Document your code thoroughly and ensure it is readable.
- Keep your code clean by removing debug statements, leftover comments, and unrelated code.
- Check your code for style and linting errors before committing.
- Follow the project's coding standards and conventions.
- Be open to feedback and willing to make necessary changes based on code reviews.

### Pull Request Workflow

- Create PRs early.
  Work-in-progress PRs are welcome; mark them as drafts on GitHub.
- Use a clear title, reference related issues by number, and describe the changes.
  Follow the PR template; only omit the issue reference if not applicable.
- CI runs on all supported platforms to build, test, format, and lint.
  All checks must pass before merging.
- When ready, convert the draft to a regular PR and request a review from a maintainer.
  If unsure, ask in PR comments.
  If you are a first-time contributor, mention a maintainer in a comment to request a review.
- If your PR gets a "Changes requested" review, address the feedback and push updates to the same branch.
  Do not close and reopen a new PR.
  Respond to comments to signal that you have addressed the feedback.
  Do not resolve review comments yourself; the reviewer will do so once satisfied.
- Re-request a review after pushing changes that address feedback.
- Do not squash commits locally; maintainers typically squash on merge.
  Avoid rebasing or force-pushing before reviews; you may rebase after addressing feedback if desired.

## Get Started 🎉

Ready to contribute? We value contributions from people with all levels of experience. In particular, if this is your first PR, not everything has to be perfect. We will guide you through the process.

## Installation

### Initial Setup

1. **Get the code**

   **External Contribution**

   If you do not have write access to the [iqm-finland/QDMI-on-IQM](https://github.com/iqm-finland/QDMI-on-IQM) repository, fork the repository on GitHub (see <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo>) and clone your fork locally.

   ```console
   $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/QDMI-on-IQM.git
   ```

   **Internal Contribution**

   If you do have write access to the [iqm-finland/QDMI-on-IQM](https://github.com/iqm-finland/QDMI-on-IQM) repository, clone the repository locally.

   ```console
   $ git clone git@github.com:iqm-finland/QDMI-on-IQM.git
   ```

2. **Change into the project directory**

   ```console
   $ cd QDMI-on-IQM
   ```

3. **Create a branch for local development**

   ```console
   $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

   Now you can make your changes locally.

4. **Install pre-commit hooks** (recommended)

   The project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks for running linters and formatting tools on each commit. These checks can be run automatically on every commit via [prek](https://prek.j178.dev) (recommended).

   To set this up, install prek, e.g., via:

   **macOS and Linux:**

   ```console
   $ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/j178/prek/releases/latest/download/prek-installer.sh | sh
   ```

   **Windows:**

   ```console
   $ powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://github.com/j178/prek/releases/latest/download/prek-installer.ps1 | iex"
   ```

   **Using uv:**

   ```console
   $ uv tool install prek
   ```

   Then run:

   ```console
   $ prek install
   ```

## Working on the C++ Library

Building the project requires a C++20-capable C++ compiler and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.24 or newer.

### Configure and Build

This project uses CMake as the main build configuration tool. Building a project using CMake is a two-stage process. First, CMake needs to be _configured_ by calling:

```console
$ cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_IQM_QDMI_TESTS=ON
```

This tells CMake to:

- search the current directory `.` (passed via `-S`) for a `CMakeLists.txt` file,
- process it into a directory `build` (passed via `-B`),
- configure a `Release` build (passed via `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`) as opposed to, e.g., a `Debug` build, and
- enable building the tests (passed via `-DBUILD_IQM_QDMI_TESTS=ON`).

Additional useful flags:

- `-DIQM_QDMI_COVERAGE=ON` to enable code coverage support

After configuring with CMake, the project can be built by calling:

```console
$ cmake --build build --config Release
```

This builds the project in the `build` directory (passed via `--build`). Some operating systems and development environments explicitly require a configuration to be set, which is why the `--config` flag is also passed to the build command. The flag `--parallel <NUMBER_OF_THREADS>` may be added to trigger a parallel build.

Building the project this way generates:

- the main project libraries in the `build/src` directory and
- some test executables in the `build/test` directory.

:::{note}
This project uses CMake's [`FetchContent`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html) module to download and build its dependencies. The first time you configure the project, you will need an active internet connection to fetch the required libraries. Subsequent builds will use the cached dependencies.
:::

### Running the C++ Tests and Code Coverage

We use the [GoogleTest](https://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html) framework for unit testing of the C++ library. All tests are contained in the `test` directory, which is further divided into:

- **Unit Tests** (`test/unit/`): Self-contained tests that do not require external dependencies or a live connection to IQM hardware.
- **Integration Tests** (`test/integration/`): Tests that require a live connection to an IQM backend.

You are expected to write tests for any new features you implement and ensure that all tests pass. Our CI pipeline on GitHub will also run the tests and check for any failures. It will also collect code coverage information and upload it to Codecov. Our goal is to have new contributions at least maintain the current code coverage level, while striving for covering as much of the code as possible. Try to write meaningful tests that actually test the correctness of the code and not just exercise the code paths.

To run the tests, use CMake's test runner [CTest](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html):

**Running all tests:**

```console
$ ctest -C Release --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

**Running only unit tests (no hardware required):**

```console
$ ctest -C Release --test-dir build/test/unit --output-on-failure
```

**Running integration tests (requires IQM access):**

Before running the integration tests, make sure you have set the necessary environment variables:

```console
$ export IQM_BASE_URL="https://desired-iqm-server.com"
$ export IQM_TOKEN="your-api-key"
$ ctest -C Release --test-dir build/test/integration --output-on-failure
```

**Generating code coverage:**

To generate a code coverage report, configure the project with `-DIQM_QDMI_COVERAGE=ON`, build, run the tests, and then use `lcov`:

```console
$ cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DBUILD_IQM_QDMI_TESTS=ON -DIQM_QDMI_COVERAGE=ON
$ cmake --build build
$ ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
$ lcov --capture --directory build --output-file coverage.info
$ lcov --remove coverage.info '/usr/*' '*/test/*' '*/build/_deps/*' --output-file coverage.info
$ lcov --list coverage.info
```

### C++ Code Formatting and Linting

This project mostly follows the [LLVM Coding Standard](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html), which is a set of guidelines for writing C++ code. To ensure the quality of the code and that it conforms to these guidelines, we use:

- [`clang-tidy`](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/), a static analysis tool that checks for common mistakes in C++ code, and
- [`clang-format`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html), a tool that automatically formats C++ code according to a given style guide.

Common IDEs like [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) have plugins that can automatically run `clang-tidy` on the code and automatically format it with `clang-format`.

- If you are using CLion, you can configure the project to use the `.clang-tidy` and `.clang-format` files in the project root directory.
- If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can install the [clangd extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd).

They will automatically execute `clang-tidy` on your code and highlight any issues. In many cases, they also provide quick-fixes for these issues. Furthermore, they provide a command to automatically format your code according to the given style.

Our `pre-commit` configuration includes `clang-format`. If you have installed `prek`, it will automatically run `clang-format` on your code before each commit. If you do not have `prek` set up, the [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci) bot will run `clang-format` on your code and automatically format it according to the style guide.

:::{tip}
Remember to pull the changes back into your local repository after the bot has formatted your code to avoid merge conflicts.
:::

Our CI pipeline will also run `clang-tidy` over the changes in your PR and report any issues it finds. Due to technical limitations, the workflow can only post PR comments if the changes are not coming from a fork. If you are working on a fork, you can still see the `clang-tidy` results in the GitHub Actions logs or on the workflow summary page.

## Working on the Python Package

The project also comes with a thin Python wrapper around the QDMI device implementation for easier distribution and integration.
The Python package is located in the `python/` directory.

### Running the Python tests

If you touch the Python package, run the relevant `nox` sessions before opening or updating a PR.

**Running the full Python test matrix:**

```console
$ uvx nox -s tests
```

**Running a single Python version locally:**

```console
$ uvx nox -s tests-3.14
```

**Running minimum-dependency tests:**

The `minimums` session runs the test suite against the minimum supported dependency versions for a specific Python version.

```console
$ uvx nox -s minimums-3.14
```

### Running the Python examples

Run the full example suite via the dedicated nox session before opening or updating a PR:

```console
$ uvx nox -s examples -- --backend sim  # simulator (no IQM access required)
$ uvx nox -s examples                   # real IQM hardware
```

For a walkthrough of each example, environment setup, and CLI options, see the [Examples](examples.md) guide.

If you touch one of these examples, update the corresponding documentation in [examples.md](examples.md) as part of the same change.

## Working on the Documentation

The documentation is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and built with Sphinx + MyST, using Doxygen XML via Breathe for the C++ API and AutoAPI for the Python package. The documentation source files can be found in the `docs/` directory.

### Writing Documentation

We expect any new additions to the code base to be documented using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) comments. When touching existing code, we encourage you to add Doxygen comments to the code you touch or refactor.

For some tips on how to write good Doxygen comments, see the [Doxygen Manual](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html).

Documentation improvements are highly valued! This includes:

- Adding or improving Doxygen comments in the C++ code
- Improving the user guides and tutorials in the `docs/` directory
- Adding examples and code snippets
- Fixing typos and improving clarity

### Building the Documentation

To build the documentation locally, run the dedicated nox session (dependencies are installed automatically by the nox session):

```console
$ uvx nox -s docs
```

The generated HTML site is written to `docs/_build/html/`.

## Tips for Development

If something goes wrong, the CI pipeline will notify you. Here are some tips for finding the cause of certain failures:

- If any of the **test checks** fail, this indicates build errors or test failures.
  Look through the respective logs on GitHub for any error or failure messages.

- If **codecov** checks fail, this means that your changes are not appropriately covered by tests or that the overall project coverage decreased too much.
  Ensure that you include tests for all your changes in the PR.

- If **cpp-linter** comments on your PR with a list of warnings, these have been raised by `clang-tidy` when checking the C++ part of your changes for warnings or style guideline violations.
  The individual messages frequently provide helpful suggestions on how to fix the warnings.

- If the **pre-commit.ci** check fails, some of the `pre-commit` checks failed and could not be fixed automatically by the pre-commit.ci bot.
  The individual log messages frequently provide helpful suggestions on how to fix the warnings.

- If the **documentation build** fails, the documentation could not be built properly.
  Inspect the corresponding log file for any errors.

## IQM API Usage in QDMI Device Implementation

This section describes how the unified IQM Server API, as defined in `iqm_api_config.hpp` and `iqm_api_config.cpp`, is used to provide the functionality of the QDMI device implementation in `iqm_device.cpp`.

### API Endpoints Used

The QDMI device implementation uses the following endpoints from the unified IQM Server API:

**Quantum Computer Management:**

- `GET_QUANTUM_COMPUTERS`: Retrieves the list of available quantum computers with their IDs and aliases.
- `GET_STATIC_QUANTUM_ARCHITECTURE`: Fetches the static quantum architecture (qubits and connectivity) for a specific quantum computer.
- `GET_DYNAMIC_QUANTUM_ARCHITECTURE`: Obtains the set of calibrated gates and their implementations for a given calibration set.
- `GET_CALIBRATION_SET_QUALITY_METRICS`: Gets calibration metrics such as qubit T1/T2 times and gate fidelities.

**Job Management:**

- `SUBMIT_CIRCUIT_JOB`: Submits a quantum circuit job (QIR or IQM JSON format) for execution.
- `GET_JOB_STATUS`: Checks the status of a submitted job.
- `GET_JOB_ARTIFACT_MEASUREMENT_COUNTS`: Retrieves the measurement results as aggregated histogram counts of a completed job.
- `GET_JOB_ARTIFACT_MEASUREMENTS`: Retrieves the individual shot measurement results of a completed job.
- `CANCEL_JOB`: Cancels a running job.

**Calibration Jobs (if supported):**

- `COCOS_HEALTH`: Health check endpoint to determine if calibration jobs are supported.
- `SUBMIT_CALIBRATION_JOB`: Submits a calibration job for execution.
- `GET_CALIBRATION_JOB_STATUS`: Checks the status of a calibration job.
- `ABORT_CALIBRATION_JOB`: Cancels a running calibration job.

### When API Calls Happen

**During Session Initialization (`IQM_QDMI_device_session_init`):**

These steps correspond to the initialization sequence described in the [Usage Guide](usage.md#session-initialization-details).

1. `GET_QUANTUM_COMPUTERS`: Fetches the list of available quantum computers.
2. The appropriate quantum computer is selected based on ID, alias, or first available.
3. `GET_STATIC_QUANTUM_ARCHITECTURE`: Retrieves the static architecture (qubits, connectivity).
4. `GET_DYNAMIC_QUANTUM_ARCHITECTURE`: Fetches calibrated gates for the default calibration set.
5. `GET_CALIBRATION_SET_QUALITY_METRICS`: Retrieves quality metrics (T1, T2, fidelities) if available.
6. `COCOS_HEALTH`: Checks whether calibration jobs are supported.

**During Job Submission and Management:**

- `SUBMIT_CIRCUIT_JOB` or `SUBMIT_CALIBRATION_JOB`: Called when `IQM_QDMI_device_job_submit` is invoked.
- `GET_JOB_STATUS` or `GET_CALIBRATION_JOB_STATUS`: Polled when `IQM_QDMI_device_job_check` or `IQM_QDMI_device_job_wait` is called.
- `GET_JOB_ARTIFACT_MEASUREMENT_COUNTS`: Fetched when histogram results are queried.
- `GET_JOB_ARTIFACT_MEASUREMENTS`: Fetched when individual shot results are queried.
- `CANCEL_JOB` or `ABORT_CALIBRATION_JOB`: Called when `IQM_QDMI_device_job_cancel` is invoked.

**After Calibration Job Completion:**

When querying results of a calibration job, the implementation automatically:

1. Extracts the new calibration set ID from the job result.
2. Calls `GET_DYNAMIC_QUANTUM_ARCHITECTURE` with the new calibration set ID.
3. Calls `GET_CALIBRATION_SET_QUALITY_METRICS` to update quality metrics.

### API Configuration

The `APIConfig` class in `iqm_api_config.hpp` provides a centralized way to build URLs for API endpoints. The base URL is set during session initialization, and endpoints are constructed using string formatting with parameters like quantum computer alias, calibration set ID, and job ID.

### Error Handling

- If an API call fails, the HTTP client returns an appropriate QDMI status code.
- Error messages are logged using the logging system.
- For calibration job endpoints, if the server doesn't support them (e.g., `COCOS_HEALTH` check fails), the `supports_calibration_jobs_` flag is set to false, and calibration job submissions will return `QDMI_ERROR_NOTSUPPORTED`.

### API Response Expectations

The implementation expects JSON responses in specific formats:

- **Quantum Computers List**: Array of objects with `id` and `alias` fields.
- **Static Architecture**: Array with a single object containing `qubits` (array of strings) and `connectivity` (array of 2-element arrays).
- **Dynamic Architecture**: Object with `calibration_set_id` (string) and `gates` (nested objects with gate details).
- **Quality Metrics**: Object with `observations` array containing `dut_field`, `value`, and `invalid` fields.
- **Job Status**: Object with job status, errors, and messages.
- **Measurement Counts Artifact**: Array with a single object containing `counts` (object mapping bitstrings to count integers).
- **Measurements Artifact**: Array typically containing a single object where each measurement key maps to an array of all shot results. Each shot result is a single-element array containing an integer (0 or 1). For example: `[{"meas_2_0_0": [[0], [1], [0], [1]], "meas_2_0_1": [[1], [0], [1], [0]]}]` represents 4 shots measuring two qubits, where each measurement key contains all results for that qubit across all shots.

For more details, see the implementation in `iqm_device.cpp` and the API configuration in `iqm_api_config.hpp`/`.cpp`.
